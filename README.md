# Pressure Monitor for Beer Brewing

PressureMon is a device for measuring pressure in storage or during fermentation.  

It supports ESP32s2 mini, ESP32s3 mini, ESP32c3 mini, ESP32c3 pico and pico and I2C compatible pressure sensors, currently the brand XIDIBEI is supported which has a good range of encapsulated sensors.

Flashing can be done using https://www.gravitymon.com/flasher/index.html?beta which also will help with wifi setup.

The documentation can be found [here](https://mp-se.github.io/pressuremon/)

PCB design is located [here](https://github.com/mp-se/pcb-designs/)
